# Motivations:
The purpose of this interactive dashboard is to provide information on recent inspection results. I created this tool to quickly visualize NYC restaurant grades.

Think about Yelp, but with unbiased results.

# How to use the dashboard:
You can type the name of your favorite restaurant on the right and find its grade.

If you are looking for a new spot in town, you can select the type of cuisine at the bottom, and the neighborhood. After that, click on the grade you would like the restaurant to have. Make sure to adjust the "score" on the right if you would like to be even more selective.

## About the dataset:
The dataset from the DOHMH includes NYC restaurant inspection results for up to three years prior to the most recent inspection.
